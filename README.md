# Sea-Level-Predictor
freeCodeCamp Project - eliotm@uoregon.edu

In this project, I analyzed the global sea level change since 1880. I used the data to predict sea level change through year 2050 by using linear regression. I created predictions based on two linear regression lines constructed from all of the data, and data from year 2000 on, respectively. The need for two lines is evident when studying the graph; data from 2000 on suggests the sea level is rising more rapidly now than prior to 2000.
